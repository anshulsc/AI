    "# Solving Word Block Problem with Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "The Word Block Problem involves arranging letter blocks to form valid words, using Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing for efficient problem-solving.\n",
    "- The challenge begins with a set of letter blocks, each containing a single letter.\n",
    "- These blocks are to be arranged to form words based on a given set of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to iteratively arrange the letter blocks to maximize the formation of valid words. Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing will guide the search for the most promising arrangement at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actions\n",
    "1. **Rearrange Blocks:** The algorithm can move blocks to different positions on the board to form new words.\n",
    "2. **Swap Blocks:** Exchange the positions of two adjacent blocks to explore different configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metric\n",
    "The effectiveness of a state is evaluated using a heuristic function specific to the Word Block Problem. This function guides the Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing by assessing the proximity of the current state to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing\n",
    "- This algorithm involves exploring neighboring states and choosing the one that brings the most significant improvement according to the heuristic.\n",
    "- Iteratively climb towards the optimal state by selecting the steepest ascent at each step.\n",
