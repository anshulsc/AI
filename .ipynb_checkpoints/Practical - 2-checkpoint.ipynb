    "# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation with Minimax Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players: 'X' and 'O'. 'X' takes odd turns, while 'O' takes even turns. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of forming a row, column, or diagonal with three consecutive marks, either 'X' or 'O'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, the problem introduces a computer player ('O') that utilizes the minimax algorithm for decision-making. The minimax algorithm is a key element of this project, enabling the computer to make strategic moves to compete against the player ('X').\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players take alternating turns to place their marks ('X' for the player, 'O' for the computer) on empty spaces in the 3x3 grid.\n",
    "- The game continues until one player successfully creates a row, column, or diagonal with three of their marks, resulting in a win, or until the grid is completely filled, leading to a draw.\n",
    "- The player's objective is to secure a win, while the computer's objective is to thwart the player's victory by employing the minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.\n"
